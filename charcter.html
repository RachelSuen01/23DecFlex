      <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
        <p>Harry James Potter is a fictional character <br>
          and the titular protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. <br> 
          <br>
          The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, <br>
          who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. <br> 
          <br>
          Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and <br>
          Wizardry to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore <br>
          and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. <br> 
          <br>
          Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, <br>
          and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort <br>
          â€“ the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, Lily and James. <br> 
          <br>
          The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle<br> 
          to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.</p>
